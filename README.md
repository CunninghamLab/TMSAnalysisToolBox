# TMS Analysis ToolBox
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Analysis Toolbox: A user friendly open source Matlab GUI for basic and advanced analysis of TMS related outcomes

TMS Analysis ToolBox is user friendly toolbox that can perform basic and advanced analysis of common transcranial magnetic stimulation based outcomes (MEP Latency/Amplitudes, Silent Periods, Paired-Pulse, Recruitment Curve (Sigmoidal Fitting and AUC)). Further, the toolBox allows for easy organization of data, retrieval of results, and data visualization (waveform and group level).
